* Matrix Unwinding Function

* About

=unwindm= is a MATLAB function that computes the matrix unwinding function of
a square matrix  A.

Other program files are

- =test_uwnindm=: runs some simple tests for the =unwindm= function.
- =unwind= computes the scalar unwinding number.

* Usage

=U = unwindm(A)= compute the matrix unwinding function =U= of the
n-by-n matrix =A=.

* Requirements

The code was developed in MATLAB R2020b and works with versions
back to at least R2017a.
